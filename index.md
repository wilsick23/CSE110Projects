## **About Me**
My name is **Wilson Nguyen** and I am a **third year** in **Muir College**. I am majoring in *Cognitive Science Design and Interation* with a minor in *Computer Science.* I have five siblings, me being the second oldest whose names are (in age order)
1. Winston 
2. Winette
3. Winster
4. Winsfield
5. Winny

In my freetime, I like to watch [TikToks](https://www.tiktok.com/), go to raves ([this is a recent photo](C:\Users\whngu\Downloads\110rave.jpg) I took with my friends at an event this past weekend), cook new things, and listen to K-pop. My favorite kpop group is *TWICE* and my favorite song by them is [I Can't Stop Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d-D5bLDZSk).

I am in many orgs across campus, including VSA, CASA, KP, and ACM. In fact, [this picture of me](#wilson-nguyen-user-page) was taken for board photos for ACM.

## As a Programmer

I only recently started minoring in Computer Science, but the languages I know (checked) and the ones I want to learn (unchecked) are:
- [x] C
- [x] C++
- [x] Java
- [x] Python
- [ ] JavaScript (if that counts)
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] CSS
- [ ] Assembly

The classes that I have taken at UCSD for Computer Science are:
- CSE 8A
- CSE 8B
- CSE 12
- CSE 15L
- CSE 21
- CSE 30
- CSE 100

The ones that I struggled the most in were CSE 12, CSE 30, and CSE 100. Data structures are still a hard concept. In the future, I want to *hopefully* get a front-end job in FAANG.
